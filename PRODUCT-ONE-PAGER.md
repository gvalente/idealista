Product One-Pager: Idealista Trust Shield (Verbose)
===================================================

**Tagline:** Your intelligent co-pilot for navigating Barcelona's rental market with confidence.

* * * * *

1\. Problem Statement
---------------------

The process of finding a rental property on Idealista in Barcelona is a high-stakes, high-stress "gauntlet." Users, particularly vulnerable newcomers like expats and international students, are confronted with a market defined by a triad of critical, unaddressed challenges:

-   **Pervasive Trust Deficit:** The platform is rife with sophisticated scams, from advance payment fraud for non-existent properties to phishing and identity theft. Users describe it as a "cesspool of scammers," forcing them to operate with a baseline of anxiety and mistrust.

-   **Information Fog & Cognitive Overload:** The user experience is degraded by a chronic lack of high-quality information. Listings are frequently incomplete (lacking floor plans), outdated ("ghost listings"), or duplicated, forcing users to waste significant time sifting through noise.

-   **Extreme Market Pressure:** The severe housing shortage in Barcelona creates intense competition, with an average of 59 applicants for every rental listing. This hyper-competitive environment erodes due diligence and pressures users into making snap decisions, amplifying their exposure to risks.

2\. Target Users & Their Core Needs
-----------------------------------

### Persona 1: Elena Schmidt (The Relocating Professional)

-   **Job to Be Done (JTBD):** When I'm starting a new chapter of my life in a competitive and unfamiliar city, I want to quickly and safely navigate the high-stakes property search process, so I can secure a legitimate home with confidence and focus on my new career without the fear of being scammed out of my savings.

-   **User Stories:**

    1.  **Scam Keyword Detection:** As a remote apartment hunter, I want to be automatically warned about common scam-related language in a listing's description, so that I can immediately identify and deprioritize high-risk listings.

    2.  **Price Anomaly Detection:** As a newcomer, I want to see if a listing's price is significantly below the market average for its area, so that I can instantly spot "too good to be true" offers.

    3.  **Listing Quality Score:** As a busy professional, I want to see a "Listing Quality Score" based on objective criteria (floor plan, photo count, description length), so that I can prioritize listings from serious agents.

    4.  **Listing Freshness Indicator:** As someone in a fast-moving market, I want to clearly see how recently a listing was updated, so that I can avoid pursuing "ghost listings."

    5.  **Duplicate Listing Detection:** As a detail-oriented researcher, I want to be alerted when the same property is listed multiple times, so that I can reduce cognitive noise.

    6.  **Advertiser Professionalism Check:** As a cautious renter, I want to be alerted if a supposed agency is using a generic email domain, so that I can be skeptical of their legitimacy.

    7.  **Consolidated "Trust & Quality" Score:** As an overwhelmed user, I want to see a single, at-a-glance "Trust & Quality Score," so that I can quickly triage properties.

### Persona 2: Leo Rossi (The International Student)

-   **Job to Be Done (JTBD):** When I'm moving abroad for the first time on a tight budget, I want to find a verifiably legitimate and affordable room with a proper contract, so I can fulfill my student visa requirements and avoid losing my limited savings to fraud.

-   **User Stories:**

    1.  **"Too Good to Be True" Scam Alert:** As a budget-conscious student, I want to be explicitly warned when a listing's price is unrealistically low, so that I can resist the temptation of scams.

    2.  **Identity Theft Prevention:** As an international student, I want to be warned about listings that demand sensitive personal documents upfront, so that I can protect my data.

    3.  **Listing Completeness for Remote Decisions:** As a student who can't visit in person, I want to easily see if a listing includes essential information like a floor plan and many photos, so that I can gain confidence.

    4.  **Duplicate Agent Detection:** As a first-time renter, I want to know if the same room is advertised by multiple people, so that I can avoid confusion and potential danger.

    5.  **Prioritizing Private Landlords:** As a student without a local employment contract, I want to easily identify listings posted by private individuals, so that I can focus on landlords who may be more flexible.

    6.  **Basic Red Flag Checklist:** As someone unfamiliar with Spanish rental norms, I want to see a simple checklist that flags common red flags, so that I can learn what to look out for.

    7.  **Overall Legitimacy Signal:** As a student needing a secure home, I want to see a clear signal (e.g., a green checkmark) that indicates a listing has no major red flags.
